# Experimentation-Driven-Decision-Making-End-to-End-A-B-Testing-Causal-Thinking-

Hi, my name is Tanisha. I'm a data science student that will be following a 6 month plan to specialize in Experimentation-Driven Decision Making (End-to-End A/B Testing & Causal Thinking).

# 2️⃣ Capstone Experimentation Project (Portfolio-Grade)

### **Project Name**

**Experimentation Platform for a Consumer Product**

You can frame this as:

- **Netflix-style streaming feature**
- **Luxury retail personalization**
- **Marketplace optimization**

---

### **Capstone Structure**

**Problem**

Example: “How do we increase long-term engagement without harming trust or brand value?”

**Hypothesis**

Clearly defined causal hypothesis

**Design**

- Metrics (primary, guardrails)
- Power analysis
- Randomization plan
- Risks and confounders

**Execution**

- Simulated or real dataset
- Python notebooks
- A/B + bandit comparison

**Decision**

- Ship / iterate / kill
- Confidence level
- Follow-up experiments
